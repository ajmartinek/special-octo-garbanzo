The business model for the non-custodial peer-to-peer NFT swap protocol on Ethereum would involve generating revenue through transaction fees.
Users of the protocol would pay a small fee every time they initiate, cancel, or complete a swap. These fees would be collected by the contract and could be used to cover the costs of maintaining and improving the protocol, as well as generating profit for the developers or other stakeholders.
Additionally, the protocol could potentially be extended to support other features or services, such as NFT storage and management, that could also generate revenue through fees or other means.
Overall, the business model for the protocol would focus on providing a valuable service to users and generating revenue through the use of that service.
In terms of monetization, the fees collected from transaction could be used to fund the ongoing development and maintenance of the protocol. This could involve hiring developers to work on new features and improvements, as well as covering any operational costs such as hosting and infrastructure.
Additionally, the fees could be used to incentivize the adoption of the protocol by offering rewards or other incentives to users who contribute to its growth and success. This could include referral programs, rewards for active users, and other similar initiatives.
Integrate it with other blockchain platforms or technologies. For example, the protocol could be adapted to support cross-chain NFT swaps, allowing users to trade NFTs between different blockchain networks. This would open up new possibilities for NFT trading and could make the protocol more attractive to a wider audience.
Another approach could be to integrate the protocol with other decentralized finance (DeFi) services, such as lending and borrowing platforms, to create new opportunities for NFT-based finance. This could involve using NFTs as collateral for loans, or creating new financial instruments based on NFTs.
Overall, the key to making the non-custodial peer-to-peer NFT swap protocol on Ethereum a novel idea would be to explore new and innovative ways of leveraging the technology to create value for users and drive adoption.

Some potential ideas for additional features that could help a protocol like this win a hackathon include:
Integration with popular NFT marketplaces and exchanges, allowing users to easily trade their NFTs on a variety of platforms.
Support for a wider range of NFT standards and formats, such as ERC-1155 and ERC-998, to increase the flexibility and interoperability of the protocol.
A built-in reputation system that allows users to rate and review each other, providing a measure of trust and transparency in the NFT trading process.
A user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to initiate, cancel, and complete NFT swaps, even if they are not familiar with blockchain technology.
A smart contract-based escrow system that can be used to hold funds and NFTs in a secure and transparent manner during the swap process.
A set of customizable rules and parameters that allow users to define the terms and conditions of their swaps, such as minimum and maximum prices, expiration dates, and other conditions.
